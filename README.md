These web apps were created by me while taking a course on Udemy. I was permitted to use them as my portfolio. 

<strong>BUDGETY:</strong> Budgety is a simple budget app that allows you to record income and expenses, calculates the net balance, calculates and displays in percentage how much each expense affects the total income, etc. 

NB: It has no database yet.
